        <h3>Exponential &amp; logistic growth</h3>
        <p>In exponential growth, a population's per capita (per individual) growth rate stays the same regardless of population size, making the population grow faster and faster as it gets larger.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>In nature, populations may grow exponentially for some period, but they will ultimately be limited by resource availability.</li>
        <li>In logistic growth, a population's per capita growth rate gets smaller and smaller as population size approaches a maximum imposed by limited resources in the environment, known as the carrying capacity (KKK).</li>
        <li>Exponential growth produces a J-shaped curve, while logistic growth produces an S-shaped curve.</li>
        </ul>        
        <h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>In theory, any kind of organism could take over the Earth just by reproducing. For instance, imagine that we started with a single pair of male and female rabbits. If these rabbits and their descendants reproduced at top speed ("like bunnies") for 777 years, without any deaths, we would have enough rabbits to cover the entire state of Rhode Island start superscript, 1, comma, 2, comma, 3, end superscript. And that's not even so impressive ‚Äì if we used E. coli bacteria instead, we could start with just one bacterium and have enough bacteria to cover the Earth with a 111-foot layer in just 36 hours!</p>

<p>As you've probably noticed, there isn't a 111-foot layer of bacteria covering the entire Earth (at least, not at my house), nor have bunnies taken possession of Rhode Island. Why, then, don't we see these populations getting as big as they theoretically could? E. coli, rabbits, and all living organisms need specific resources, such as nutrients and suitable environments, in order to survive and reproduce. These resources aren‚Äôt unlimited, and a population can only reach a size that match the availability of resources in its local environment.</p>

<p>Population ecologists use a variety of mathematical methods to model population dynamics (how populations change in size and composition over time). Some of these models represent growth without environmental constraints, while others include "ceilings" determined by limited resources. Mathematical models of populations can be used to accurately describe changes occurring in a population and, importantly, to predict future changes.</p>

            <p>The figure above shows how the logistic and exponential models are constructed. After reading this text it should be obvious to us that the growth of the virus cannot be exponential indefinitely and therefore we will use a logistic model to predict the number of deaths.</p>
            <h3>The logistic function:</h3>

A logistic function or logistic curve is a common "S" shape this type of curve is known as a sigmoid and its equations is the following:

$$f(t) = \frac{K}{1 + e^{-r(t-t_0)}}.$$

        <ul> 
        <li> $e$ = the natural logarithm base (also known as Euler's number),</li>
        <li> $t_0$ = the $t$-value of the sigmoid where the rate starts to decreas, at the same time this point is the midpoint of the sigmoid's evolution,</li>
        <li> $K$ = the curve's maximum value; in this case the maximum number of deaths and</li>
        <li> $r$ = the logistic growth rate or steepness of the curve</li>
        </ul>

        Variational inference is a great approach for doing really complex, often intractable Bayesian inference in approximate form. Common methods (e.g. ADVI) lack from complexity so that approximate posterior does not reveal the true nature of underlying problem. In some applications it can yield unreliable decisions.

        <h4>Method used - Variational Inference - OPVI:</h4>
        <h5>*Text from: <a href=" https://docs.pymc.io/api/inference.html"> https://docs.pymc.io/api/inference.html</a>*</h5> 
            <p>
            Variational inference is a great approach for doing really complex, often intractable Bayesian inference in approximate form. Common methods (e.g. ADVI) lack from complexity so that approximate posterior does not reveal the true nature of underlying problem. In some applications it can yield unreliable decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
            Recently on NIPS 2017 OPVI framework was presented. It generalizes variational inference so that the problem is build with blocks. The first and essential block is Model itself. Second is Approximation, in some cases ùëôùëúùëîùëÑ(ùê∑) is not really needed. Necessity depends on the third and fourth part of that black box, Operator and Test Function respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
            Operator is like an approach we use, it constructs loss from given Model, Approximation and Test Function. The last one is not needed if we minimize KL Divergence from Q to posterior. As a drawback we need to compute ùëôùëúùëûùëÑ(ùê∑). Sometimes approximation family is intractable and ùëôùëúùëûùëÑ(ùê∑) is not available, here comes LS(Langevin Stein) Operator with a set of test functions.
            </p>
            <p>
            Test Function has more unintuitive meaning. It is usually used with LS operator and represents all we want from our approximate distribution. For any given vector based function of ùëß LS operator yields zero mean function under posterior. ùëôùëúùëûùëÑ(ùê∑) is no more needed. That opens a door to rich approximation families as neural networks.
